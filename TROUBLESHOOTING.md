# Troubleshooting Portfolio CSV Upload Issues

## Enhanced Parser Now Active âœ…

Your CSV parser has been upgraded with better error handling and support for more broker formats.

## Quick Fixes for CSV Upload Issues

### 1. **File Format Issues**
If you see "Could not parse CSV file or file is empty":

**Solution A: Check File Content**
- Open your CSV file in a text editor (Notepad++)
- Make sure it has actual data, not just headers
- Look for the structure: Symbol, Quantity, Market Value columns

**Solution B: Re-download Portfolio File**
- Go back to your broker website
- Download a fresh copy of your portfolio
- Try different export formats if available (CSV, Excel â†’ Save as CSV)

### 2. **Broker-Specific Formats**

**Charles Schwab**: Works best with "Positions" export
**Fidelity**: Use "Portfolio Positions" download  
**TD Ameritrade**: Export from "My Account" â†’ "Positions"
**E*TRADE**: Download "Portfolio" summary

### 3. **File Path Issues**
- Make sure file is in your Downloads folder or desktop
- Avoid special characters in filename
- Try renaming file to simple name like "portfolio.csv"

### 4. **Test with Sample File**
Use our sample file to test the system:
```
Upload: data/sample_portfolios/sample_portfolio.csv
```

## If Still Having Issues

### Debug Your File
1. **Open CSV in Excel/Google Sheets** - Does it look reasonable?
2. **Check for Empty Rows** - Remove any blank rows at top/bottom
3. **Verify Data Types** - Numbers should be numbers, not text
4. **Save as UTF-8** - Re-save file with UTF-8 encoding

### Alternative Upload Methods
1. **Copy-Paste**: Copy data from Excel and save as new CSV
2. **Manual Entry**: Use our sample format as template
3. **Different Export**: Try different export option from your broker

## Still Need Help?

- "Portfolio file appears to be empty" â†’ Re-download file
