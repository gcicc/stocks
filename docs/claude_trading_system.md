# Claude.md - AI Portfolio Management System

## Project Overview
An automated portfolio management system where Claude analyzes micro-cap stocks (under $300M market cap) and makes autonomous trading decisions within defined parameters. The system combines real market data ingestion, deep research capabilities, and systematic portfolio management.

## System Architecture

### Data Pipeline
- **Data Source**: GitHub repository with daily market data
- **Data Types**: Prices, volumes, market cap, fundamental metrics, news sentiment
- **Update Frequency**: Daily market data, weekend deep analysis
- **Storage**: Local SQLite/PostgreSQL for historical data, pandas for analysis

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Ingestion Module (`data_ingester.py`)
```python
# Fetch daily market data from GitHub
# Update local database
# Validate data quality
# Generate data quality reports
```

#### 2. Claude Integration Module (`claude_interface.py`)
```python
# Interface with Claude API
# Pass market data and portfolio state
# Receive trading decisions and research analysis
# Log all interactions for audit trail
```

#### 3. Portfolio Manager (`portfolio_manager.py`)
```python
# Track current positions
# Calculate performance metrics
# Generate portfolio reports
# Validate trade constraints (micro-cap only, position limits)
```

#### 4. Research Engine (`research_engine.py`)
```python
# Weekend deep analysis workflows
# Stock screening and idea generation
# Risk assessment and position sizing
# Performance attribution analysis
```

## Claude Prompt Engineering

### Daily Analysis Prompt
```
You are managing a micro-cap portfolio (under $300M market cap). 

Current Portfolio State: {portfolio_json}
Market Data: {market_data_json}
Date: {current_date}
Time Remaining: {days_until_end} days

Based on this data, should you:
1. Make any position changes?
2. Adjust stop-losses?
3. Take profits on any positions?

Respond with specific actions in JSON format.
```

### Weekend Research Prompt
```
Weekend Deep Research Session

Portfolio: {portfolio_json}
Recent Performance: {performance_metrics}
Market Environment: {market_summary}

Tasks:
1. Analyze current holdings for continued validity
2. Screen for new micro-cap opportunities
3. Assess sector rotation opportunities
4. Update risk management parameters

Provide detailed research with specific actionable recommendations.
```

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

### Compliance
- **Disclosure**: This is a simulated trading system for educational purposes
- **Not Financial Advice**: Results should not be considered investment advice
- **Risk Warning**: Micro-cap stocks carry significant risks
- **Data Usage**: Ensure compliance with data provider terms of service

### Risk Disclaimers
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Micro-cap stocks are highly volatile and illiquid
- System may experience technical failures
- Human oversight required for all trade executions

## Success Metrics & Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Absolute Return**: Target 20%+ over 6-month period
2. **Risk Management**: Maximum drawdown < 25%
3. **Research Quality**: Document all investment theses
4. **System Reliability**: 99%+ uptime for daily analysis

### Lessons Learned from Their Experience

**What's Working Well**:
- The AI outperforming key benchmarks over four weeks validates the core concept
- Structured prompt engineering with specific order formats produces actionable results
- Weekly deep research sessions provide necessary context for decisions
- CSV-based tracking is simple but effective for transparency

**Critical Improvements Needed**:
- **Manual workflow bottleneck**: "ALL PROMPTING IS MANUAL AT THE MOMENT" limits scalability
- **Statistical validity concerns**: "Statistical reliability is extremely weak â€” trends may appear significant but are likely the result of randomness"
- **Technical debt**: "All of this is still VERY NEW, so there is bugs"
- **Limited data sources**: Only yFinance for micro-cap data may miss important information

**Risk Management Insights**:
- "Micro-cap, low-float, speculative, or illiquid securities, which can be subject to extreme volatility, bid-ask spread issues, or complete capital loss"
- Need for sophisticated liquidity and spread monitoring
- Importance of proper position sizing for volatile micro-caps
