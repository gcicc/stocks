## Key Concepts & Definitions

### Financial Terms

**Alpha**
- The excess return generated by a strategy compared to a benchmark
- Positive alpha = outperforming the market
- Example: If your strategy returns 12% and the S&P 500 returns 10%, your alpha is +2%

**Beta**
- Measures how much your portfolio moves relative to the overall market
- Beta = 1: Moves with the market
- Beta > 1: More volatile than the market
- Beta < 1: Less volatile than the market
- Example: Beta of 1.2 means your portfolio typically moves 20% more than the market

**Sharpe Ratio**
- Risk-adjusted return measure (return per unit of risk)
- Higher Sharpe ratio = better risk-adjusted performance
- Formula: (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Volatility
- Good Sharpe ratio: > 1.0, Excellent: > 2.0

**Information Ratio**
- Measures risk-adjusted excess return over a benchmark
- Formula: (Portfolio Return - Benchmark Return) / Tracking Error
- Higher is better, indicates consistent outperformance

**Maximum Drawdown**
- Largest peak-to-trough decline in portfolio value
- Measures worst-case scenario risk
- Example: Portfolio drops from $100k to $80k = 20% maximum drawdown

**Volatility**
- Measure of price fluctuation over time
- Higher volatility = more risk and potential reward
- Calculated as standard deviation of returns

**Tracking Error**
- Standard deviation of the difference between portfolio and benchmark returns
- Measures how closely your strategy follows the benchmark
- Lower tracking error = more similar to benchmark performance

### Position Sizing Terms

**Position Size**
- The amount of money allocated to a specific stock or trade
- Usually expressed as percentage of total portfolio
- Example: 5% position size = $5,000 investment in a $100,000 portfolio

**Kelly Criterion**
- Mathematical formula for optimal position sizing
- Considers win probability and average win/loss amounts
- Formula: f = (bp - q) / b, where:
  - f = fraction of capital to wager
  - b = odds received on the wager
  - p = probability of winning
  - q = probability of losing (1 - p)

**Risk Parity**
- Position sizing method where each position contributes equal risk
- Larger positions in less volatile stocks, smaller in more volatile
- Goal: balanced risk distribution across portfolio

## Technical Analysis Explained

### Momentum Analysis

**What is Momentum?**
Momentum in finance refers to the tendency of rising stock prices to continue rising and falling prices to continue falling. It's based on the principle that "the trend is your friend."

**Why Momentum Works:**
- **Behavioral Finance**: Investors often underreact to news, creating trends
- **Institutional Flows**: Large funds take time to build/reduce positions
- **Information Diffusion**: News spreads gradually through the market
- **Risk-On/Risk-Off**: Market sentiment creates sustained moves

### Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA)

**What is TEMA?**
TEMA is an advanced moving average that reacts faster to price changes than simple moving averages by applying exponential smoothing three times.

**How it Works:**
1. Calculate first exponential moving average (EMA1)
2. Calculate second EMA of EMA1 (EMA2)
3. Calculate third EMA of EMA2 (EMA3)
4. TEMA = 3×EMA1 - 3×EMA2 + EMA3

**Why TEMA is Superior:**
- **Faster Response**: Reacts quicker to price changes than simple moving averages
- **Less Lag**: Reduced delay in identifying trend changes
- **Smoother**: Filters out market noise better than basic indicators
- **Trend Identification**: Excellent for identifying momentum direction

**TEMA Signals:**
- **Price above TEMA + Rising TEMA** = Strong uptrend (BUY signal)
- **Price below TEMA + Falling TEMA** = Strong downtrend (SELL signal)
- **Price near TEMA + Flat TEMA** = Sideways trend (HOLD signal)

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis

**Concept:**
Analyzes momentum across different time periods simultaneously to confirm trend strength.

**Our Implementation:**
- **Short-term (7-day)**: Captures immediate price momentum
- **Medium-term (14-day)**: Identifies intermediate trends
- **Long-term (28-day)**: Confirms major trend direction

**Signal Confirmation:**
- **All timeframes aligned** = Strong signal (high confidence)
- **Mixed timeframes** = Weak signal (lower confidence)
- **Contradictory timeframes** = No clear trend (HOLD)

### Divergence Detection

**What is Divergence?**
When price moves in one direction but momentum indicators move in the opposite direction, signaling potential trend reversal.

**Types:**
- **Bullish Divergence**: Price makes lower lows, but momentum makes higher lows (potential upward reversal)
- **Bearish Divergence**: Price makes higher highs, but momentum makes lower highs (potential downward reversal)

**Why Divergences Matter:**
- Early warning of trend weakness
- Often precede significant price reversals
- Help identify optimal entry/exit points

## Risk Management Concepts

### Position Sizing Methods

**Equal Weight**
- **Method**: Divide portfolio equally among all positions
- **Pros**: Simple, ensures diversification
- **Cons**: Doesn't account for individual stock risk
- **When to Use**: Conservative investors, broad diversification

**Kelly Criterion**
- **Method**: Mathematical optimization of position size based on win/loss probabilities
- **Pros**: Theoretically optimal, maximizes long-term growth
- **Cons**: Can suggest large positions, requires accurate probability estimates
- **When to Use**: Experienced traders with good win rate data

**Risk Parity**
- **Method**: Each position contributes equal risk (volatility-adjusted)
- **Pros**: Balanced risk exposure, reduces concentration risk
- **Cons**: May overweight low-volatility stocks
- **When to Use**: Risk-conscious investors, volatile markets

**Volatility Adjusted**
- **Method**: Larger positions in less volatile stocks
- **Pros**: Automatically adjusts for risk, simple to understand
- **Cons**: May miss opportunities in volatile growth stocks
- **When to Use**: Conservative growth strategies

### Stop Loss Methods

**Fixed Percentage**
- **Method**: Exit position when it drops X% from entry price
- **Example**: 5% stop loss = sell if stock drops 5% from purchase price
- **Pros**: Simple, predictable risk
- **Cons**: May trigger on normal volatility

**ATR-Based (Average True Range)**
- **Method**: Stop loss based on stock's typical price range
- **Calculation**: Stop = Current Price - (ATR × Multiplier)
- **Pros**: Adapts to each stock's volatility
- **Cons**: More complex, requires parameter tuning

**Dynamic**
- **Method**: Adjusts stop loss based on signal strength and market conditions
- **Logic**: Stronger signals get tighter stops, weaker signals get looser stops
- **Pros**: Optimized for each situation
- **Cons**: Most complex to implement

### Portfolio Risk Metrics

**Correlation**
- **Definition**: How much stocks move together
- **Range**: -1 (perfect negative) to +1 (perfect positive correlation)
- **Risk Implication**: High correlation = less diversification benefit
- **Target**: Keep correlations below 0.7 for good diversification

**Concentration Risk**
- **Definition**: Risk from having too much money in one position or sector
- **Measurement**: Percentage of portfolio in largest positions
- **Mitigation**: Position size limits, diversification rules

**Value at Risk (VaR)**
- **Definition**: Maximum expected loss over a given time period at a specific confidence level
- **Example**: 5% daily VaR of $10,000 means 95% confidence that daily loss won't exceed $10,000
- **Use**: Setting position limits, risk budgeting

## Trading Signal Logic

### Signal Generation Process

1. **Data Collection**
   - Fetch recent price data (typically 60-200 days)
   - Calculate volume and volatility metrics
   - Ensure data quality and completeness

2. **Momentum Calculation**
   - Apply TEMA across multiple timeframes
   - Calculate momentum strength and direction
   - Assess trend consistency

3. **Signal Determination**
   - Compare current momentum to historical patterns
   - Apply signal filters for quality control
   - Generate preliminary BUY/SELL/HOLD recommendation

4. **Confidence Assessment**
   - Evaluate signal strength across timeframes
   - Check for confirmation from multiple indicators
   - Assign confidence level (0-100%)

5. **Final Signal Output**
   - Combine signal direction with confidence level
   - Provide reasoning for recommendation
   - Include risk metrics and position suggestions

### BUY Signal Criteria

A BUY signal is generated when **ALL** of the following conditions are met:

**Primary Conditions:**
- **Price above TEMA**: Current price > TEMA value
- **Positive Momentum**: Momentum indicator > 0
- **Rising Trend**: TEMA is increasing (not flat or declining)

**Confirmation Factors:**
- **Multi-timeframe Alignment**: Short, medium, and long-term momentum agree
- **Sufficient Strength**: Momentum strength above minimum threshold
- **Volume Confirmation**: Above-average trading volume supports the move
- **No Recent Divergence**: Price and momentum moving in same direction

**Confidence Modifiers:**
- **High Confidence (80%+)**: All timeframes strongly aligned, high momentum strength
- **Medium Confidence (50-79%)**: Most timeframes aligned, moderate strength
- **Low Confidence (20-49%)**: Mixed signals, weak momentum

**Example BUY Scenario:**
```
Symbol: AAPL
Price: $180 (above TEMA at $175)
Momentum: +2.5 (strong positive)
Timeframe Alignment: Short(+), Medium(+), Long(+)
Volume: 150% of average
Signal: BUY
Confidence: 85%
Reason: "Strong upward momentum with multi-timeframe confirmation"
```

### SELL Signal Criteria

A SELL signal is generated when **ALL** of the following conditions are met:

**Primary Conditions:**
- **Price below TEMA**: Current price < TEMA value
- **Negative Momentum**: Momentum indicator < 0
- **Falling Trend**: TEMA is decreasing

**Confirmation Factors:**
- **Multi-timeframe Bearish**: Multiple timeframes show downward momentum
- **Sufficient Weakness**: Momentum strength below negative threshold
- **Volume Confirmation**: Selling pressure evidenced by volume
- **Bearish Divergence**: Price making higher highs while momentum makes lower highs

**Risk Factors:**
- **Breakdown Below Support**: Price breaking key technical levels
- **Deteriorating Fundamentals**: If fundamental data available
- **Sector Weakness**: Related stocks also declining

**Example SELL Scenario:**
```
Symbol: NFLX
Price: $420 (below TEMA at $435)
Momentum: -1.8 (strong negative)
Timeframe Alignment: Short(-), Medium(-), Long(-)
Divergence: Bearish (price higher highs, momentum lower highs)
Signal: SELL
Confidence: 78%
Reason: "Negative momentum with bearish divergence across timeframes"
```

### HOLD Signal Criteria

A HOLD signal is the default when neither BUY nor SELL criteria are met:

**Common HOLD Scenarios:**
- **Sideways Trend**: Price oscillating around TEMA with flat trend
- **Mixed Signals**: Some timeframes bullish, others bearish
- **Low Momentum**: Momentum near zero, indicating consolidation
- **Insufficient Confidence**: Signal strength below minimum threshold
- **Recent Signal**: Already have position, waiting for exit signal

**Signal Filtering:**
- **Confidence Too Low**: Even if BUY/SELL criteria met, confidence < 20%
- **Contradictory Timeframes**: Short-term and long-term disagree significantly
- **Low Volume**: Insufficient trading activity to confirm signal
- **Market Conditions**: During high volatility periods, raise signal thresholds

**Example HOLD Scenario:**
```
Symbol: GOOGL
Price: $142 (near TEMA at $141)
Momentum: +0.1 (weak positive)
Timeframe Alignment: Short(+), Medium(neutral), Long(-)
Volume: 80% of average
Signal: HOLD
Confidence: 35%
Reason: "Mixed momentum signals across timeframes, awaiting clearer direction"
```

### Signal Quality Filters

The platform applies several filters to ensure high-quality signals:

1. **Minimum Confidence Threshold**
   - BUY/SELL signals must have >40% confidence
   - Signals below threshold automatically become HOLD

2. **Timeframe Consistency**
   - Prefer signals where multiple timeframes align
   - Penalize signals with contradictory timeframes

3. **Volume Confirmation**
   - Require above-average volume for strong signals
   - Low volume signals get reduced confidence

4. **Recent Signal History**
   - Avoid flip-flopping between BUY/SELL
   - Require cooling-off period after signal changes

5. **Market Volatility Adjustment**
   - Raise signal thresholds during high volatility periods
   - Lower thresholds during stable market conditions

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Platform Questions

**Q: How often should I run the analysis?**
A: Weekly is typically sufficient for momentum strategies. Daily analysis can lead to overtrading and noise.

**Q: What file format should my portfolio be in?**
A: CSV format with columns for Symbol, Quantity, and Market Value. The platform can handle various broker export formats.

**Q: Can I analyze individual stocks instead of a portfolio?**
A: Yes, you can create a CSV with just one stock or use the sample portfolios provided.

**Q: How far back does the analysis look?**
A: The platform analyzes 60-200 days of price history depending on the indicator and data availability.

### Technical Analysis Questions

**Q: What's the difference between momentum and trend?**
A: Momentum measures the rate of price change, while trend measures direction. You can have strong momentum in either direction.

**Q: Why do I get HOLD signals for most of my stocks?**
A: This is normal and conservative. Only stocks with clear, high-confidence momentum signals generate BUY/SELL recommendations.

**Q: Should I follow all BUY signals?**
A: Focus on signals with >70% confidence and consider your risk tolerance. Don't follow signals you don't understand.

**Q: What if the momentum analysis contradicts fundamental analysis?**
A: The platform focuses on technical momentum. Consider both technical and fundamental factors in your decisions.

### Risk Management Questions

**Q: What's the best position sizing method?**
A: Kelly Criterion is theoretically optimal but can suggest large positions. Risk Parity is good for balanced portfolios. Start conservative.

**Q: How much should I allocate per position?**
A: The platform suggests position sizes, but never risk more than you can afford to lose. 5-10% per position is common.

**Q: Should I use stop losses?**
A: Stop losses help limit downside risk. ATR-based stops adapt to each stock's volatility patterns.

**Q: What's a good Sharpe ratio?**
A: >1.0 is good, >1.5 is very good, >2.0 is excellent. Compare to your benchmark and risk-free rate.

### Backtesting Questions

**Q: Why doesn't backtesting show trades even with BUY signals?**
A: The backtesting uses more conservative parameters. Signals need higher confidence and strength to trigger actual trades.

**Q: Is backtesting performance realistic?**
A: Backtesting includes trading costs and slippage but can't predict future performance. Use it to understand strategy behavior.

**Q: What's a good benchmark comparison?**
A: Positive alpha (outperforming S&P 500) is good, but also consider risk-adjusted metrics like Sharpe ratio and maximum drawdown.

**Q: How do I interpret correlation in backtesting?**
A: High correlation (>0.7) between positions reduces diversification benefits. The platform monitors this automatically.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: My CSV upload failed. What's wrong?**
A: Ensure your CSV has Symbol, Quantity, and Market Value columns. Check for special characters or formatting issues.

**Q: Why do I get "no data available" errors?**
A: Some symbols may be delisted or have insufficient trading history. The platform will skip these automatically.

**Q: The analysis seems slow. Is this normal?**
A: Initial analysis can take 30-60 seconds depending on portfolio size. Subsequent analyses are faster due to data caching.

**Q: Can I export my analysis results?**
A: Currently, you can copy signal summaries. PDF and Excel export features are coming in future updates.
